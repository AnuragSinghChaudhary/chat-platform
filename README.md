# Chat-platform

This platform revolves around the real-time application, which functions the way to create a room using a `room code name`, which is needed to be shared with only those candidate those who are required to be present in that room.

As it is a real-time app therefore only those people can view the data who are part of the `room`, other people cannot view the data.

If anyone joins a room then he cannot view the conversation which happened before he joined.

How to run the App locally:
* Clone it locally on your computer using `git clone https://github.com/codeuino/chat-platform.git`
* Install NodeJs
